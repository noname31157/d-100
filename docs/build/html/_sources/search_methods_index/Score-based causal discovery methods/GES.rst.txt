GES with the BIC score or generalized score
==============================================

Algorithm Introduction
--------------------------------------

Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm with BIC score [1]_ and generalized score [2]_.


Usage
----------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from causallearn.search.ScoreBased.GES import ges
    Record = ges(X, score_func, maxP, parameters)

Parameters
-------------------
**X**: Data with T*D dimensions.

**score_func**: The score function you would like to use, including (see :ref:`score_functions`.).
              - ":ref:`local_score_BIC <BIC score>`": BIC score [3]_.
              - ":ref:`local_score_BDeu <BDeu score>`": BDeu score [4]_.
              - ":ref:`local_score_CV_general <Generalized score with cross validation>`": Generalized score with cross validation for data with single-dimensional variates [2]_.
              - ":ref:`local_score_marginal_general <Generalized score with marginal likelihood>`": Generalized score with marginal likelihood for data with single-dimensional variates [2]_.
              - ":ref:`local_score_CV_multi <Generalized score with cross validation>`": Generalized score with cross validation for data with multi-dimensional variables [2]_.
              - ":ref:`local_score_marginal_multi <Generalized score with marginal likelihood>`": Generalized score with marginal likelihood for data with multi-dimensional variates [2]_.

**maxP**: Allowed maximum number of parents when searching the graph.

**parameters**: when using CV likelihood,
              - parameters['kfold']: k-fold cross validation.
              - parameters['lambda']: regularization parameter.
              - parameters['dlabel']: for variables with multi-dimensions, indicate which dimensions belong to the i-th variable.



Returns
-------------------
- **Record['G']**: learned causal graph.

- **Record['update1']**: each update (Insert operator) in the forward step.

- **Record['update2']**: each update (Delete operator) in the backward step.

- **Record['G_step1']**: learned graph at each step in the forward step.

- **Record['G_step2']**: learned graph at each step in the backward step.

- **Record['score']**: the score of the learned graph.
